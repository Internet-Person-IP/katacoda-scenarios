# Fix Code and Push Code

The final thing you need to is look at the src/App.js.

In here you might be able to see that the code is actually only couting upwards. You decided to fix that and add a feature that counts down.

You then added and commit the changes and similar to step 6 push the code to your remote to your trigger branch.

You will now wait for the CloudBuild another 5mins and then boom you should see the updated Code deployed which Counts both up and down.
