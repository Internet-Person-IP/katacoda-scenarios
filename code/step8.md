# Clean-Up and Conclusion

After working on this assignment from Netlight you realize that this project was really helpful in enabling you to understand some aspects of DevOps.

In here you learned how to:

1. Leverage IaC using Terraform
2. Create a Kubernetes Cluster using GKE
3. Deploy a Docker Image to Kubernetes
4. Create a CI/CD pipeline for Kubernetes cluster
5. Use that CI/CD pipeline to update some frontend code


**Finally, you can end this entire tutorial by going to the terraform directory and typing:**

> `terraform destroy`{{copy}}

which will destroy your entire infrastructure.

Thank you for attending this fun tutorial and I hope you learned something.
